If you are at all interested in Behavior-Driven Development, then you need to clear your calendar and watch [this series by Dave Farley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXh0iUt4TXA&list=PLwLLcwQlnXByKR1Fo7UnE6gQAbx-JfYJZ).

And here's why:

### Reason #1

To understand how you can go from a vague idea of what Users need from your software to precise specifications that you can execute. See how testing can help us not only to build code that works correctly, but also helps us to build the correct software.

### Reason #2

To understand 4 layers you need to build a robust testing architecture. Separate your test cases from the System Under Test to represent what the system does, not how it does it, with the concepts of Domain Specific Language and Protocol Drivers.

Only then you won't need to rewrite your test cases if an implementation detail changes.

### Reason #3

What's the difference between End-to-End Testing and Acceptance Testing, and why it might not be a best idea to use the former. Using the latter helps us create a more reliable and faster testing pipeline.

Honestly, it completely changed the way I think about how you can build software from the perspective of a User.

I can't believe stuff like this is free on the Internet.
