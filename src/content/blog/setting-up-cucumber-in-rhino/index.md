**End-to-end testing can easily get difficult to maintain if we don't pay extra attention.**

End-to-end testing, compared to unit testing requires more setup to get the system to the desired state. If we don't reuse test code, testing scripts may get very difficult to update if the application changes. We can manage the complexity by wrapping reusable steps in functions and hiding page structure with [Page Objects](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html). Those are good ideas, but even then, what we're testing is obscured by the programming language syntax.

**We can abstract it even further, use an approach that makes it super clear what we're testing.**

[Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) is a tool allows you to write tests in a human-readable format, using [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) â€“ a language that is structured to be easy to understand by non-programmers and easy to parse by a test runner.


**What is easier to understand what is tested?**

Pure Cypress test?

```js
// cypress/integration/login.cy.js
describe('login', () => {
  it('user should be able to log in', () => {
    cy.visit('/')

    // open the login modal
    cy.get('button').contains('Login').click()

    // fill in the form
    cy.get('input[type="email"]').type('test@test.com')
    cy.get('input[type="password"]').type('test123')

    // submit the form
    cy.get('button').contains('Sign in').click()
    cy.contains('button', 'Logout').should('be.visible')
  })
})
```

Or a Cucumber specification:

```gherkin
// cypress/integration/login.feature
Feature: login
  Scenario: user should be able to log in
    Given I visit the homepage
    When I open the login modal
    And I fill in the form
    And I submit the form
    Then I should be logged in
```

with support JS code?

```js
// cypress/integration/login.js
const { Given, When, Then } = require("@cypress/cucumber-preprocessor");

Given("I visit the homepage", () => {
  cy.visit("/");
});

When("I open the login modal", () => {
  cy.get("button").contains("Login").click();
});

When("I fill in the form", (email, password) => {
  cy.get('input[type="email"]').type(email);
  cy.get('input[type="password"]').type(password);
});

When("I submit the form", () => {
  cy.get("button").contains("Sign in").click();
});

Then("I should be logged in", () => {
  cy.contains("button", "Logout").should("be.visible");
});
```

If you like the latter, read on. ğŸ‘‡

## Why should you use Cucumber?

- **Clear communication** - Gherkin is a language that makes it easy to understand for your stakeholders what is tested and how the system works. We can use this format not only to test existing code, but to drive development of new requirements with [ATTD](../acceptance_test_driven_development_of_shiny_modules/).
- **Reusability** - Steps can be reused across different scenarios, leading to less code duplication.
- **Maintainability** - If the implementation changes, you only need to update the step definitions, not the scenarios themselves. We are sure we preserve the business context.
- **Separation of concerns** - Scenarios describe the behavior of the application, step definitions describe how to test it.
- **Documentation** - Scenarios can be used as a form of documentation how the system works, what are the inputs and expected outputs.

## Adding Cucumber to a Rhino project

[Rhino](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/index.html) comes packaged with [Cypress](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/articles/tutorial/write-end-to-end-tests-with-cypress.html) for end-to-end testing. To use Cucumber we can use the [cypress-cucumber-preprocessor](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor) that will parse Gherkin files and run them as Cypress tests.

Since Rhino uses `webpack` we can follow the [webpack-cjs](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/tree/master/examples/webpack-cjs) example to set up the preprocessor.

The structure of the `tests/` directory in a rhino (>=1.6.0) project looks like this:

```
tests/
  testthat/
  cypress/
    e2e/
    plugins/
    support/
      e2e.js
  cypress.config.js
```

### 1. Adding the preprocessor package

In `tests/` directory we need to add a `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor": "latest",
    "@cypress/webpack-preprocessor": "latest",
    "cypress": "latest",
    "webpack": "latest"
  }
}
```

### 2. Installing dependencies

Run `cd tests & npm install` to install those dependencies. A `tests/package-lock.json` will be created.

*ğŸ’¡ Why not install those dependencies with the rest of JavaScript dependencies in `.rhino/` directory?*

*This directory is git-ingored by design. When a newer version of `rhino` is released, the `package.json` is overwritten.*

### 3. Adjust Cypress config to use the preporcessor

We need to modify `tests/cypress.config.js` to use the cucumber preprocessor:

```js
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");
const webpack = require("@cypress/webpack-preprocessor");
const { addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin } = require("@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor");

async function setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
  await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config);

  on(
    "file:preprocessor",
    webpack({
      webpackOptions: {
        resolve: {
          extensions: [".js"],
        },
        module: {
          rules: [
            {
              test: /\.feature$/,
              use: [
                {
                  loader: "@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/webpack",
                  options: config,
                },
              ],
            },
          ],
        },
      },
    })
  );

  return config;
}

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: "http://localhost:3333",
    specPattern: "**/*.feature",
    setupNodeEvents,
  },
});
```

### 4. Adding required support file

We also need to add an empty `e2e.js` file to `tests/cypress/support/` directory.

### 5. Adding feature files and step implementations

Now we should be ready to start adding `.feature` files and their corresponding `.js` step definitions.


```feature
# cypress/e2e/duckduckgo.feature
Feature: duckduckgo.com
  Scenario: visiting the frontpage
    When I visit duckduckgo.com
    Then I should see a search bar
```

```js
// cypress/e2e/duckduckgo.ts
const { When, Then } = require("@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor");

const { When, Then } = require("@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor");

When("I visit duckduckgo.com", () => {
  cy.visit("https://duckduckgo.com/");
});

Then("I should see a search bar", () => {
  cy.get("input[type=text]")
    .should("have.attr", "placeholder")
    .and(
      "match",
      /Search the web without being tracked|Search without being tracked/
    );

  assert.deepEqual({}, {});
});
```

### 6. Making tests run on CI

If you push those changes to CI you'll notice that they fail because we don't have the preprocessor installed.

To make it work on CI let's modify `rhino-ci.yml`

At any step before one that runs Cypress tests we need to install the preprocessor.

```yaml
- name: Install Cucumber preprocessor
  if: always()
  run: >
    cd tests && npm install
```

After that tests should run ğŸš€.
